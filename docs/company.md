## Mission
The DDEV mission is to empower open source developers who seek the freedom to choose the tools and platforms that support the way they want to work.

Go from dev to deploy to maintain to "It Just Works."

## Vision
Our VISION is simple and not so simple at the same time: **Advancing Developer Communities**.  

We are a thriving part of the developer community working to advance developers and their communities beyond where they are today. Together we can paint a picture of what tomorrow can & should be:

A world where developers are helping each other grow stronger, build faster, and collaboratively achieve solutions is what DDEV is all about.
